        <div class="body"><p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The division between those who consider themselves &quot;owners&quot; of an originally idealistic movement, and those who believe to be simply &quot;members&quot; or servants of such ideals, is a classical prelude to a weakening process or the final destruction of such institution.<br />
ISKCON is not an exception. As Srila Prabhupada warned us,&quot; it can be spoiled&quot;.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Money and the influence over others, who either serve, in good faith that their energy is invested for the purpose the movement was started for, or those who don&acute;t mind to serve lies as lies come easy and don&acute;t demand much thinking, create the environment the &quot;owners&quot; strive in.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some of their qualities they can be identified with:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1/</strong> ISKCON owner is a kanistha adhikari as he is not motivated by progressive preaching work, the essence of Srila Prabhupada&acute;s movement.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2</strong>/ As a staunch kanistha adhikari, he is often fascinated by mundane mayavadi concepts. Even if academically educated, he cannot be identified as a brahmana, the lover of the Truth.<br />
The most dangerous amongst ISKCON owners are those who actually do posses some sort of brahminical qualities, such as austerity and cleanliness, but use these assets to dominate others and achieve distinction and fame. Fortunately, they are very few.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3/</strong> Such owner is mostly of sudra, or when more intelligent, of vaisya nature.<br />
The sudra type is of a sentimental nature. Whoever hurts his feelings and does not accept his emotionally based understanding of the world, is for him a &quot;vaisnava aparadhi&quot;.<br />
&zwnj;Such person ends up being surrounded mostly by women or men who act like women as they are more receptive for his sentimental modes and moods.<br />
&zwnj;Vaisya type of an ISKCON owner is more dangerous. For him &quot;money is the honey&quot; and acquiring it from naive sentimental souls is for him an essential need. With this money he will &quot;buy&quot; his prestige and his &quot;friends&quot;, better to say his allies.<br />
When sudra owner howls in distress, the vaisya owner keeps his poker face and engages in politics to achieve his goals.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&zwnj;4/</strong> Kanistha adhikari will always envy or obstruct the work of a madhyam adhikari member devotee.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&zwnj;5/</strong> Institutional identity is for an owner everything. His title, his designation is for him a license to impose himself upon preaching madhyam adhikari and demand, not command authority over him.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&zwnj;6/</strong> Absolute absence of introspection and immunity against any sort of constructive criticism are the prerogatives of an owner. For him a foolish &quot;friend&quot; is of far greater value than a more intelligent critic. Herewith such ISKCON owner cannot be rectified.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&zwnj;7/</strong> In the name of &#39;mercy&quot; and &quot;forgiveness&quot;, even basic moral values of human society can be compromised by such an owner.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&zwnj;8/</strong> ISKCON owner never takes responsibility for his actions, but always defines the disastrous results of his actions as being &quot;circumstantial&quot; or fault of others.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&zwnj;9/</strong> There is only one law, which can correct such man or women - the law of karma. It may force him or her to return in next lifetime in another body, in order to return the services of those he or she used so voraciously in this life.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&zwnj;10/ </strong>ISKCON owner demanding blind followership creates a self destructive society, where &zwnj;&quot;blind leads the blind&quot;, forcing the more intelligent class of devotees either to retreat in shame, &zwnj;or join other movements, which seem to be more devotionally idealistic... only to find soon or later the same brand of &quot;society owners&quot; and &quot;society members&quot;.<br />
&zwnj;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&zwnj;As this comparative study would not be complete without description of an ISKCON member, here are another ten points defining his or her qualities:<br />
&zwnj;<br />
<strong>&zwnj;1/ </strong>ISKCON member is a madhyam adhikari, clearly distinguishing between devotees, demons and innocently confused ones.<br />
&zwnj;He does so by dint of their consciousness (thinking, feeling and desiring), and not by their external bodily designations or institutional status.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&zwnj;2/</strong> Madyam adhikari, even not greatly academically educated, such a member instinctively abstains from any mayavadi demoniac dogmas established by leaders of mundane society. In times of need his knowledge is inspired from within by the Supersoul, whereby the &quot;knowledge&quot; of an ISKCON owner is clearly inspired by the illusory energy of the Lord, Maya.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&zwnj;3/</strong> ISKCON member, even when not necessarily endowed with great academic intelligence, being a pure hearted soul, seeks service to the Founder Acharya, Srila Prabhupada, in a materially unmotivated way, satisfied with the knowledge that such a service is ahaituky apratihata, it cannot be hindered by any material &zwnj;circumstances.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&zwnj;4</strong>/ A true member is always inspired by the service of other members and seeks ways how to serve such jewel like devotees.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&zwnj;5</strong>/ For a member, the institution is valid only when it serves its purpose. In Srila Prabhupada&acute;s view, ISKCON &zwnj;was started as &quot;organized attempt&quot; to inform conditioned souls about Krsna Consciousness, and engage them in AUTHORIZED services to guru parampara.<br />
&zwnj;Herewith it is the duty of every ISKCON member to facilitate anybody who is willing to be engaged according to the instructions of the Founder Acharya Srila Prabhupada.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&zwnj;6/ </strong>A member always seeks association of other members, even at the cost his shortcomings may be exposed.<br />
After all, he perceives Srila Prabhupada&acute;s movement to be a medical institution where the diseased conditioned souls may receive the best medicine and the best treatment according to the prescription of the chief doctor, the Founder Acharya.<br />
&zwnj;Such an introspective attitude ensures to a real member of Srila Prabhupada&acute;s movement &zwnj;a swift progress on the path back home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&zwnj;7/</strong> Basic moral values of a human society are for a member a natural need for anybody who seeks cultivation of a spiritual life.<br />
Seeing the facilitation of the most degraded types of behaviour, as done by the &zwnj;&quot;pragmatic&quot; ISKCON owners, a member who is in need to protect his dignity &zwnj;and basic moral integrity, seeks rather seclusion while being ostracized by ISKCON owners.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&zwnj;8/</strong> It is also for this reason, a member is cautious in regards to his actions, specifically the ways he may accept service from others. Aware of the karmic consequences of their actions, the members are rather willing to be designated as separatist and traitors by the ownership class of men, who in the name of &quot;unity in stupidity&quot; join the mainstream propaganda of the owners.<br />
Money and fame are unimportant to the members. Above all they value the dignity given to them by the authorized spiritual master.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&zwnj;9/</strong> Being aware of the severe &zwnj;karmic consequences of his actions, a member always seeks opportunities to serve other members than to accept services from others.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&zwnj;10/ </strong>ISKCON member is an automatic carrier of the mercy of the guru parampara, and so in his presence and under his leadership victory, prosperity, exemplary morality, and the final reassurement of return to Godhead can be found. All this was experienced during Srila Prabhupada&acute;s presence by those who acted as true IKCON members, and all this can be re-enacted again when Srila Prabhupada&acute;s vani, His heritage, is kept as the central guideline to our activities.<br />
