        <div class="body"><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The following letter from Srila Prabhupada, written on 12th of November 1967 in Calcutta to Subal Prabhu (below), in the early days of the explosive development of ISKCON all over the planet, reveals in the most wonderful way the purpose, the essence and the mood of Srila Prabhupada&#39;s preaching movement.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This letter surely reflects the words of Bhaktisiddhanta Maharaja who said that one Moon in the sky gives more brightness than all the other stars, and so if attracting one Moon, so much light can be disseminated to those dwelling in darkness.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Here in Srila Prabhupada doesn&#39;t hesitate to share the disappointment with those of His disciples who already in His presence came to misunderstand their position as servants of the servants and considered themselves &bdquo;the distinctively chosen ones&ldquo;. Simultaneously, Srila Prabhupada is discouraging the megalomaniac nature, mostly initiated from the US, the heartland of megalomania. Quality, and not quantity, was His policy. Being the most merciful representative of the most merciful incarnation of the Lord, He did finally accept even those who later on proved themselves to be unworthy of His amazing tolerance and benevolence. But this cannot be imitated as it is done today, where quantity over quality is eagerly sought by some of the ruthlessly followers-collecting &bdquo;leaders&ldquo;.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
These words of Srila Prabhupada are relevant today as never before. Discouraging indiscriminate initiations of unqualified disciples for the sake of possible status and monetary gain, these words discourage the policy that &bdquo;money is the honey&ldquo; maintained by some business-minded &bdquo;renunciates&ldquo;.&nbsp; This letter makes clear that &bdquo;purity of purpose&ldquo; is the force which can drive Srila Prabhupada&#39;s movement to dimensions we cannot even imagine.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The total destruction of basic moral standards of human society seems to be the norm of today where we can observe that even the ten commands are ruthlessly compromised by those who call themselves &bdquo;preachers&ldquo;. There is no use to preach philosophy when the morality of basic kind is compromised. Who may listen to a society filled with cheaters, opportunists, pedophiles and abusers of grossest kind? Only those of similar nature. Even common simple conditioned souls will recognize the hypocrisy behind our words when we allow deviants of the grossest kind to masquerade as devotees, preachers and leaders.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Real devotees will be never too many, we know that. Those of truly brahminical nature are almost impossible to find. Visualizing this Srila Prabhupada stressed the need to be at least situated along one&acute;s varna and asrama, as the basis of our preaching is to create a human society.<br />
Today&acute;s stressed issues are often of the most trivial nature: issues of the social kind, medical and populist kind. Such issues seem to some &bdquo;leaders&ldquo; to be of more importance than to maintain the purity Srila Prabhupada based His movement on.<br />
Basic moral standards of humanity are often compromised in the name of &bdquo;mercy&ldquo;, forgetting a possibility that many of the demon-like persons are also attracted to Srila Prabhupada&acute;s movement, seeking fame, and above all monetary profits, enabling them to exercise control over others by misusing other&acute;s pious innocence.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The recent pandemonia fraud, globally schemed by occasionally united demons, is in a most embarrassing way reflected by naive or cuckooed ones amongst those &bdquo;preachers&ldquo; who associate with devotees. The situation becomes truly dangerous or even catastrophic when such &bdquo;leaders&ldquo; advocate the potentially deadly vaccination schemes of the demoniac scientific community, which serves eagerly the demons&acute; purpose.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">How is it possible, that devotees who preached their whole lives that we are not this body and our lives depend entirely on guru&acute;s and Krsna&acute;s mercy, can encourage their followers to inject chemicals unknown to us in their bodies, in vain hope to be &bdquo;protected&ldquo;? How come that these preachers became so foolish to actually say that:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">1 - Krsna cannot finally protect His devotee and He is not the One who will decide when the time has come for His devotee to stay or to go?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The demoniac pharmaceutical industry based on profit making and assisting the leading demons to introduce a threat, and then provide a solution for it, so the ignorant masses may eagerly seek shelter at the very same place the threat came from?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Srila Prabhupada exposed this demoniac timeless policy on several occasions, like during His morning walks in Hyderabad on 14th April, 1975 or in L.A. on 14th February, 1973.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">2 - Srila Prabhupada&acute;s aversion to Western medical help manifested by His policy&bdquo;never bring me to a hospital&ldquo; is already forgotten?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&bdquo;Needles, needles, needles, that&acute;s all what your Western doctors can do, stick needles into your body&ldquo;, He said...</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The vaccination preachers boldly copy the demoniac policies and claim we can be &bdquo;protected&ldquo; by some undefined and unknown chemicals injected into our bodies. Even there is already a clear evidence how damaging this vaccination can be, some false claim that questioning this vaccination pandemonia is &bdquo;work of fanatics&ldquo;.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">3 - Such preachers claim actually that devotional service is not anymore ahaituky apratihata, not depending on material circumstances, and so we have to accept demon&acute;s offer and &bdquo;get protected&ldquo; &hellip; so we can serve Krsna better?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
4 - Will these vaccinations-preachers take responsibility for the eventual premature death of their followers?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Surely they will not as they will claim &bdquo;the death occurs according to the present circumstances&ldquo;.<br />
In a similar way, such fools advocate &bdquo;circumstantial divorce&ldquo; (a term I learned from my present GBC :-) and other &bdquo;circumstantial needs to be met&ldquo;. While totally ignoring the law of karma they so often lecture about, believing it is not concerning them.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
Whatever else has to be said in terms of the basis and mood of Srila Prabhupada&acute;s movement is said in this concerned letter to Subal Prabhu:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>&bdquo;...In Krsna Consciousness there is a variety, but there is no discord. We may fight with one another on the point of serving, but that is not a discord. We must stick to the service of the Lord very seriously and that will help us make progress. In this connection I have written one letter to Brahmananda the portion in which you may be interested is subjoined herein.&ldquo;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">(Letter continues with the part of the letter to Brahmananda)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>&bdquo;I do not want crowd of Kirtanandas, but I want a single soul like Brahmananda, Mukunda, Rayarama and Satswarupa&hellip; I have seen your statement regarding opening centers. I am not in agreement with Mr. Altman that we are expanding very thinly. In my opinion, a single sincere soul can maintain a center.<br />
You know, I started the center at 26 2nd Ave, alone. I took the risk of&nbsp; $200 rent. At that time there were no assistants. Mukunda was a friend, but there was no responsibility for him for maintaining the center. Gradually Kirtananda, Hayagriva joined but they did not take any responsibility. Still, I was maintaining the establishment simply by depending on Krishna and then Krishna sent me everything, men and money.<br />
Similarly, if a sincere soul goes out and opens a center in any part of the world, Krishna will help him in all respects.<br />
Without being empowered by Krishna nobody can preach Krishna Consciousness. It is not academic qualification or financial strength which helps in the matter, but it is sincerity of purpose which helps us always. Therefore I wish that you will remain in charge of Santa Fe.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>In this way you will follow my example as I did in the beginning at 26 2nd Ave. That is preaching, cooking, writing, talking, chanting, everything one man&acute;s show. I never thought about the audience. I was prepared to chant even if there were no men present to hear me. The principle of chanting is to glorify the Lord and not to attract a crowd. If Krishna hears nicely, then He will ask some sincere devotee to gather in such place. Therefore be advised that thousands of centers may be started if we find out a sincere soul for each and every center.&ldquo;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>More when we meet. Hope you are well.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Your ever well-wisher A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">End of the letter to Subal Prabhu.</p>
