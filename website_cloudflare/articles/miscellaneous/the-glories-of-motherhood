        <div class="body"><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This article carries autobiographical features and is written by male-bodied devotee of the Lord.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What does a man know about giving birth to a child?<br />
Nothing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
Here lies one of the first glories of a mother, she can do something a man could never do. It is something which is of most essential nature while we are living in this world of birth, disease, old age and death.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">From the three features of the material energy disease, old, age and death come naturally without our direct involvement. But birth is something which happens (speaking about the natural ways), which requires cooperation of mother and father, husband and wife. (Only animals reproduce themselves in an unrestricted way.)<br />
That means choices have to be made and facilitating the appearance of a child is taken in Vedic (Vedic means human) society most seriously. In Bhagavad Gita we find that both Krsna and Arjuna are concerned what happens with children appearing from the wombs of unmarried, means unprotected, women.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
It is this protection women enjoy while being married to a responsible husband, which worries the demons, men powered by lust only.<br />
How can they hunt down a woman of their liking when there is another man standing in their way? Even some of this debauchees don&acute;t care and try to seduce a woman in the presence of her husband, life can get difficult for them, or even dangerous.<br />
It is this class of men who invented the idea of FEMINISM, which women so naively and foolishly accepted. Now, indoctrinated with the concept to be God/esses, they degraded to the level of prostitutes, roaming the street exposed and abused by any cunning man who comes their way.<br />
Their screams of frustrated material desires and anguish of being betrayed so many times are of little help. It is the cunning class of men who indoctrinated them with the idea that they are free, and (being far more socially sensitive) they can become dominant in the society by serving their economical purposes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed,&nbsp; &quot;liberated&quot; women study worthless &quot;knowledge&quot; for years in some academic institutions, just to be respected later on in a society of fools and rascals. Neglecting her biological constitution, such woman, missing the most reproductive period of her life, finds herself in desperate state of mind when crossing her forties, with her reproductive organs being ruined by contraceptives, possibly seeking an artificial insemination or adopting a foreign child in order not to become an angry, aggressive and vicious old women. Some simply buy themselves a dog.<br />
In a society dominated by demoniac lusty men such appearances are common, with few exceptions, of course, which only confirm the rule.<br />
What to speak of those women who kill their children in the process of their &quot;career&quot; by abortion, collecting terrible karma resulting in lunacy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This to be said, the glory of a responsible woman who (sometimes in hope against hope) tries to give her care and love to her offsprings, and her chastity to human values gives her the strength desperate feministic women seek.<br />
It is for this reason a mother is considered in Vedic terms to be one of the gurus, as it is her example which the child perceives emotionally first. She is the one providing nourishment and protection in first place.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As demoniac men become baffled by the results of their actions, in this case feeding the lust of a women, which grows in uncontrollable proportions (by sexual indulgence a woman grows stronger and the man weaker), their greed comes back on heads of such men like a boomerang, making them puppets in hands of career seeking women who increasingly occupy the ranks of leadership.<br />
In this way a society of cheaters and cheated is created, a self destructive society indeed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After spending seventeen years living as a brahmacary, a celibacy monk, I came to understand that my fierce need to protect has to be regulated.<br />
After getting married by dint of arranged marriage (I was lucky, mentors being involved knew what they were doing), spending eight years of fierce preaching with my wife. (Srila Prabhupada in a revolutionary way put his grhasta married couples into the preaching field with immense success. After all, practically all the first major temples in His rapidly growing movement were established by grhasta couples!)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Then I finally faced one of the biggest challenges in my life... I had to become a father.<br />
Even very late (no problem for the man, but surely a huge problem for the women), finally a child was born. Living in a country where the presence of the father at the birth of his child is common, I had first hand experience how close birth and death can be.<br />
Finally, both mother and child surviving, I was presented by the nurses a small girl who looked at me... as an old man.<br />
I was deeply impressed by looking into the eyes of this person, seeing the amazement and disgust of the old man from previous life with an expression on the face of the reborn infant &quot;oh no, not once again!&quot;<br />
This glimpse of a previous life lasted only for a few seconds and then I held in my hands... a baby girl.<br />
At that moment my perception of women in general changed, and being aware how tremendously devoted they can be, to see the drama of motherhood being played in front of my eyes, I thought only:<br />
&quot;I could never endure this kind of austerity, give so much, risk my life, and render so much service for the benefit of an entirely unknown person.&quot;<br />
And so I could feel only respect for them who can do what a man could never do: to give a birth to a child.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To be a mother is the&nbsp; most respected position in human society. In animal society, females have to fight for their survival and the survival of their offsprings, often abandoned by ruthless males.<br />
In the human society, both parents try to give their child maximum opportunities to be part of any devotional spiritual activity, giving them a spiritual base they can rely on throughout their whole life. Although the children become finally adults and have to make decisions on their own, it is the example of the father and the mother, which finally remains deeply engraved in their consciousness.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">And so the glories of a self-sacrificing mother can never be pointed out enough, as this in itself contradicts the demoniac policies of the today&acute;s society.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Motherhood and chastity provide dignity to those women who know how to value it. If not, their doom is to follow the dogmas established by demons of today... and became prostitutes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
