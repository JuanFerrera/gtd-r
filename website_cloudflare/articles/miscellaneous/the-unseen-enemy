        <div class="body"><p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Naturally, in times when governments world wide reach out for radical measures in order to regulate and eliminate the &quot;coronavirus danger&quot;, many conspiracy theories can be heard, nourished by the very same people who initiated or just used the &quot;virus&quot; so they can do what they need to.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">This text is written by an entirely unprofessional person when it comes to economical, medical&nbsp;or social studies connected to the world wide pandemonium being announced by one government after another.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Points being soon made here don&#39;t require some professional expertises, it takes just common sense and lots of time being spent in dealing with people, something I have done throughout my life.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">We have here Bhagavad-gita clearly defining the mentality of the &bdquo;virus creators&ldquo; and &bdquo;virus users&ldquo;. Such people, called demons, don&#39;t know what has to be done and what shouldn&#39;t be done. Driven by desire to gain control over others and the final domination of the world, trying to play God in their ways, they are engaged in&nbsp;ugra karma, work meant simply for the destruction of this world and its inhabitants.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">If the virus&nbsp; leaked out of the laboratory due to some sort of accident, or was intentionally released is not important. Historically spoken such plagues were always here, affecting and eliminating far more victims&nbsp;than this virus did sofar.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">It is a flue virus and even it may be specially aggressive, this kind of disease was here continually, every year, causing many to become sick or to die.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">So why now suddenly such world wide urgency?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Yes, the situation is urgent, but not&nbsp; because of some virus.&nbsp;It is clear even for simple minded people that the hedonistically overheated economy the demons set in motion years ago, has to be cooled down one way or another, otherwise like&nbsp;a monstrous overheated machine, it will blow up into the face of its creators.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">How does one achieve such &bdquo;cooling&nbsp; effect&ldquo;? Can one tell people &bdquo;hey, cool down, times are becoming more demanding, don&#39;t buy so much, don&#39;t try to enjoy so much, don&#39;t dream so much about more sense gratification, we are anyway going to die and face the results of our sinfull activities&quot;? Certainly not.</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">There is nothing more the general masses of people are afraid of as the truth. Truth brings austerity, truth brings responsibility to everyone who wants to have it. Lies come easy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">For years, generations of people were trained to be addicted to most bizarre types of sense gratification, working hard, shopping, working hard again and shopping again, and then again working hard and buying whatever was sold to them in pursue of their sense gratification. What will they do now when the leaders may inform them that it is time to step back and become more modest in one&#39;s demands? Will the masses listen? Can a heroin addicted person be told to reduce his consumption of the drug?&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Certainly not.&nbsp;Addicted workers and buyers will get simply furious, accusing those they worshiped once upon a time not to have fulfilled what they promised. Populists of all kind will arrive on the scene, promising bright future while calling for a revolution against the previous establishment, and so the show of deceit and&nbsp;opportunism will go on. The demoniac leaders know this very well, they are the masters of the art of deception.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">And so to bring the derailed consumption circus to a hold, some more radical measures are needed. Usually, one&nbsp;set works&nbsp;in any&nbsp;time and is &bdquo;history approved&ldquo;. The good old... WAR.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Its so easy to&nbsp;initiate it but sometimes is not so easy to stop it.</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Demons know it as well. War is a great business. War creates new markets, war brings down the established world order and installs a new one. After every war conducted sofar, things got only worse in terms of moral and spiritual values. What was considered fifty years ago vulgar and immoral, is in many regards&nbsp;the norm today.</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">But war is risky, and in present context is deemed to be not practical. In war there must be the good ones and the bad ones, the heroes and the culprits. So why not create or faciliate an enemy nobody sees, everybody is afraid of, an enemy of alien kind, an enemy whose attack is unpredictable but still controlled.&nbsp;Enemy, which can be enlarged&nbsp; in numbers anytime, reduced or reproduced again -&nbsp;it all depends on the reports published by the media, reports nobody can verify.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Such unseen enemy will bring everybody to a hold, and the ones who initiated his appearance will never be seen. For anonymous leaders, masses of humans are just numbers, what do they care how many small fish get eaten by the big ones once again? Claiming to be the owners of the whole ocean, they can count the losses while aiming for the profit. Small enterprises, as matter of fact any individual human endeavor will be once more restricted and finally eliminated. Everything will get even more centralized and in most detailed way controlled, while the leaders will intoxicate themselves with high sounding slogans in regards to democracy, freedom and humanistic ideals. Was certain Bernard Shaw right when he stated that democracy is the last trick of tyrany? We will see.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">In this case the culprit is clearly defined. No court case is needed, no human right considerations have to be made. The accused one is clearly identified: It was the virus.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">It was him and not us, the leaders. It was him and not us, the followers.&nbsp;We who try to imitate&nbsp;God, who are the cause of this desastrous situation, either as leaders or a followers, we love to believe to be the victims and not the abusers. What a wonderful thing this virus is. It doesn&#39;t cost&nbsp;as much as to finance a whole war machinery and it brings the same effect. Restrictions of movement for the masses, elimination of some, creation of new markets in the following damage repair times, and&nbsp;gaining more control over others who &bdquo;need to be protected&ldquo;.&nbsp;One couldn&#39;t wish for more.</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">As the leaders advocate to hide our faces behind masks, they hide their faces behind media machinery they control well. Machinery, which is useful tool to install fear in peoples&#39; hearts and enable the controlling class to control the rest.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&quot;History is not kind to those who play God&quot;, states in James Bond movie. And while growing old and retiring, Mr Bond is right. :) Confirmed by the Bhagavad-gita such demons will face their doom, eliminated by the very same means they put in motion. The laws of material energy are strict and uncompromising.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Will their policy to &bdquo;cool down&ldquo; the conomy and make others to suffer for this &bdquo;cooling effect&ldquo; work?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Here comes the final news. While putting us all in quarantine, this whole world is created by the Supreme Lord as quarantine area for all those who defied His Supremacy, and developed independent desires in their own. This wonderful jail, this&nbsp;material world, is designed so wonderfully that nobody wants to escape. Even tormented day and night by threefold miseries inflicted upon us by other living entities (like our all-pervaiding virus), supernatural powers, and our own fragile bodies, we refuse to understand and we refuse to take any active step towards&nbsp;freeing ourselves from this compromised state.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">In order to make us aware of our unnatural situation, pain is brought into our lives, as pain is the ultimate warning devise that something is wrong and we should move ourselves out of the given environment dictated to us.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Will some listen to the warning the pain&nbsp;dispatches to us ? Maybe. Amongst thousands maybe one will take notice. So says Bhagavad-gita.The rest will try to find material means to change material problems over and over stubbornly, creating even worse problems.</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">The deadly virus may come and go, but death as such will stay. The desire not to want to die is real, but the means to achieve such immortality are false.</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">At least regarding the proclaimed virus pandemic, one statement done by media could be considered as being honest: we can do nothing about it. To urge people to walk around with their faces covered while keeping two meters distance from each other is rather a theatrical&nbsp;display of our helplesness, as everybody knows this &bdquo;better something&nbsp;than nothing&ldquo; policy resembles a man trying to extinguish a forest fire with his water pistol. Those who are destined to die will have to die, and those who are destined to survive will survive.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Shall we then do nothing? Not at all, we may try to do what we consider the needful, but in all our endeavors we should be aware that we are not the Supreme Controlers, and in whatever way possible we should try to learn from the given situation and not embark again on the hedonistic path of self destruction.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">As&nbsp;Mr Bernard Shaw said, &bdquo;the only thing we can learn from experience is that nobody learns anything from experience&ldquo;. Some may learn something, and those rare souls need all support they can get.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Srila Prabhupada came for this purpose, to help those few who are truly seeking a change and truly want to improve their lives in terms of turning them from material to spiritual quality.</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Does that mean we should simply pray and wait? In this regard Srila Prabhupada stated that &bdquo;God helps those who help themselves&ldquo;. And so He urged us to modify our lives into spiritual lives, a gradual process of increasing self awareness and natural renounciation of useless endeavors for highten state of sense gratification. Srila Prabhupada also urged us to offer some tengible alternative, to&nbsp; stay close to the land, obstain from demoniac propaganda and work hard to show others how to do the same.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p lang="en" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Virus will come and go, but the stupidity of the masses will stay. &nbsp;And so to &bdquo;infect people with real knowledge&ldquo; is the task Srila Prabhupada left for us to realize.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">How long will demons keep the masses in quarantine? As long&nbsp;as suits to&nbsp;them. This virus war they started has only one outcome -&nbsp;many may suffer while few may profit from the misery of others. Some, like vultures, profit from death of others and fear in general. The medical industry is the first benefactor, others will follow. With governments dancing to the whistles of the industrialists who plan to gain more control and more facilities to corrupt others by fear and promise of false safety, it is going to be the small man on the street who will pay the bill for the virus warfare, not the ones who initiated it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Meanwhile those few who are able to ignore such false propaganda by dint of Krsna Consciousness, will finally be able to escape from this quarantine we ALL were born into, and escape the spell placedt upon us by illusory energy of the Lord. The goal of those who are cultivating Krsna Consciousness is not only to get freed from mayas shackles, but never come back again to this world, which with or without the great virus phantasmagoria offers us only birth, old age, disease and death.</p>

             <div class="body">Very good thoughts. I don't believe, however, that the virus was set free intentionally. Rather, some scientists detected a new flu virus, the media got the news and spread them widely, then the people, ignorant of medical facts, panicked and demanded that the politicians do something. The politicians had to follow, and the people, moved by anxiety, readily gave up their freedom.

But after all, it is a reaction by material nature under the direction of the Supreme Lord to the uncountable acts of violence that mankind is committing against nature, especially in the realm of animal abuse. For Krishna's devotees the sudden peace all over is a good chance to go inside while they can't go outside.</div>

             <div class="body">Well, the conspiration theories are now surely as rampant as the virus itself. As we remember Srila Prabhupada, already during His stay with us, facing Hong Kong flue epidemy, (yes, He comments rather sarcastically that "he also took some vaccination"), and in His childhood seeing massive riots in Calcutta with heaps of dead bodies laying around, leprosy colonies and other type of maladies affecting people in great numbers (how many He must have met in His pharmacy!), He finally summed it up saying, "it is maya, it is all maya who is behind all this".

But there is evidence that already 2015 an article in a "scientific" magazine appeared, describing exactly the nature of coronavirus carried by bats. At that time the virus itself was described as not being able to affect humans, but same time the scientists proudly announced, that they succeeded in making it “compatible” with human cells.

And so the biological laboratories run by demons are certainly capable to produce a new variation of already dangerous natural product and "mess it up" as usually scientists do. After messing it up they will dare to consume even more money derived finally from innocent citizens in outrageous way, so "they can offer the solution to the problem". It is like beating somebody up, change the dress and appear again on the scene as the ambulance driver. 
The one who discovered x-rays died on her own discovery, the atomic bomb is another "scientific contribution" to further destruction of mankind, and so we can only marvel at this latest scientific "accident" effecting lives of so many. Regardless if such disaster is "accidental" or was intentionally staged, as usually few may profit greatly from the misery of so many others. We are dominated by class of people who will try to turn everything in profit for themselves, not hesitating to eliminate so many on the way.

Finally Srila Prabhupada always pointed to the fact that soon or later we will die anyway, and so death is the real problem, not the virus.
Those who are pious will remember it now while the impious ones will try to solve the material problem by material means, turning out either to be helpless or making things even worse.

Such determined souls like yourself will know that we are all infected by virus of maya, and the only remedy is finally the chanting of the Holy Name and hearing of Srila Prabhupada's nectarean instructions. And so when the Holy Name appears, the sinful ones will flee in all directions while the pious ones fall at Krsna's lotus feet, holding Them in their hearts even more tightly. Thanks to the virus we will know who is who :-)
